# Mech-Checker (A Chemical Structure Answer Checker) 
### A Browser-Based Molecular Structure Input and Validation Tool  
Designed for Blackboard Ultra and LMS Integration

## Version Description

This repository contains the simplest implementation of Mech-Checker (Meck-Checker-light). It is designed for embedding within a Blackboard Ultra Document via an iframe, with the question prompt provided separately in a preceding content block. The application validates the structure drawn by the student against the criteria defined in `tasks.js`, checking molecular formula, connectivity, and (where specified) stereochemistry. It is intended for straightforward formative structure verification rather than mechanism grading or advanced interaction.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The Chemical Structure Answer Checker is a lightweight, browser-based tool developed to support **formative self-assessment in chemistry education**.

It is intended exclusively for:

- Practice exercises  
- Self-guided learning  
- Low-stakes formative activities  
- Interactive tutorials  

This tool is **not designed for summative assessment, examinations, or high-stakes grading**.

All validation is performed client-side within the student's browser, and answer structures are visible in the repository source code. As such, it should not be used where secure answer concealment is required.

---

## Overview

Students draw a molecular structure using an embedded editor and receive immediate automated feedback regarding:

- Molecular formula correctness  
- Structural connectivity  
- Regiochemistry  
- Stereochemistry (when required)

The system is hosted using GitHub Pages and requires no server infrastructure.

## Technical Architecture and Acknowledgements and Third-Party Software

The application operates entirely in the browser.

## Accessing Specific Questions

Base URL:

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker-light/

To open a specific question, append:

?task=N

Example:

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker-light/?task=2

Important: The equals sign is required (`?task=2`, not `?task2`).

---

## Question Configuration

All questions are defined in:

tasks.js

Each question follows this structure (or the single line equivalent - see tasks.js for more examples):

window.TASKS = {
  1: {
    title: "Question 1",
    formula: "C5H10O3",
    requireStereo: true,
    prompt: "Draw the correct structure.",
    answersSmiles: [
      "C[C@H](O)CC(=O)OC"
    ]
  }
};

### Field Definitions

**title**  
Displayed heading for the question.

**formula**  
Expected molecular formula. Must match the calculated formula of the correct structure.

**NB** The formula field is defunct in newer versions of the index file found in the module versions. In these later versions OpenChemLib generates the formula from the expected answer smiles. This prevents issues with Element order differences, and streamlines new question addition workflows.

**requireStereo**  
`true` — stereochemistry must match exactly.  
`false` — stereochemistry is ignored.

**prompt**  
Optional instructional text shown to students.

**answersSmiles**  
An array of acceptable SMILES strings (**Best acquired from the JSME editor itseft at https://jsme-editor.github.io/dist/JSME_test.html - see export smiles at the bottom of the page**).  
Multiple entries may be included to allow equivalent or alternative correct answers (e.g., enantiomers).

---

## Adding a New Question
**NB** The formula field is defunct in newer versions of the index file found in the module versions.

To add Question 11:

1. Open `tasks.js`
2. Add:

11: {
  title: "Question 11",
  formula: "C8H10O",
  requireStereo: false,
  prompt: "",
  answersSmiles: ["SMILES_HERE"]
},

3. Access via:

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker-light/?task=11

Or 

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker-light/modules/modulenumber/?task=11

where "modulenumber" = the unique module number associated with that set of new questions 

---

## Blackboard Ultra Integration

To embed within a Blackboard Ultra Document:

<iframe
  src="https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker-light/?task=1"
  width="100%"
  height="820"
  style="border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:12px;"
  title="Chemical Structure Answer Checker – Question 1">
</iframe>


**Each question should be embedded separately using its corresponding task number.**

---

## Updating and Maintenance

If edits do not appear immediately:

- Perform a hard refresh  
  - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R  
  - macOS: Cmd + Shift + R  

- Alternatively, increment the version parameter in `index.html`:

<script src="./tasks.js?v=2"></script>

Increase the version number after changes.

---

## Security and Assessment Disclaimer

This tool:

- Performs all validation client-side  
- Stores correct answers visibly in `tasks.js`  
- Does not conceal answer data  
- Does not provide secure authentication or grading controls  

Therefore, it is suitable only for **formative, self-directed learning activities** and should not be used for graded examinations or high-stakes assessment.
